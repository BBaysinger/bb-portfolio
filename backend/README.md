# Portfolio Backend (Payload CMS)

This is the backend service for the BB Portfolio website, built with Payload CMS and Next.js.

## Features

- Type-safe CMS with generated TypeScript types
- Project and media collections
- NDA-aware content filtering
- AWS S3 integration for media storage
- Contact form with AWS SES email
- Environment-specific configurations

## Local Development

The backend runs as part of the Docker Compose development environment. From the repository root:

1. Configure environment variables (see root README for setup)
2. Start the full development stack: `npm run caddy:up`
3. Access the admin panel at `http://localhost/admin`

The Docker setup includes:
- Backend service with hot reload
- Frontend service
- Caddy reverse proxy
- Local file storage for media

### Alternative: Standalone Development

For backend-only development:

1. Copy environment variables: `cp .env.local.example .env`
2. Configure MongoDB URI and AWS credentials in `.env`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` 
4. Start development server: `npm run dev`
5. Access admin panel at `http://localhost:3001`

## Collections

### Projects
- Portfolio projects with rich metadata (brand, tags, role, year, awards)

- Automatic slug generation and sorting

### Media Collections

## Environment Configuration

The backend supports multiple environment profiles:

- `local` - Local development with filesystem storage

Set `ENV_PROFILE` in your `.env` file to switch between configurations.
