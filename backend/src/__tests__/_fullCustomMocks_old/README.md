These custom tests are a rabbit hole I went down by some advice that custom tests are always best; however, for purposes of a how-to guide, the quick and easy route is possibly best, so I switched and provided tests via SuperTest.

Note that the file structure here is different, and the structure I adopted in **tests** is a recommended practice, though there isn't really a standard.
