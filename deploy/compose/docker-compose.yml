# =============================================================================
# Docker Compose Configuration - BB Portfolio Site
# =============================================================================
#
# This configuration supports multiple deployment environments using profiles:
# - Local development (MacBook) with hot reload and volume mounts
# - AWS EC2 development sandbox with builds on EC2
# - AWS EC2 production with pre-built ECR images
#
# QUICK START - Local Development:
# --------------------------------
# 1. Build and start services:
#    COMPOSE_PROFILES=local docker compose up --build
#
# 2. Access your applications:
#    - Frontend: http://localhost:8080 (with hot reload)
#    - Backend:  http://localhost:8081 (with auto-restart)
#
# 3. Stop services:
#    COMPOSE_PROFILES=local docker compose down
#
# USAGE BY ENVIRONMENT:
# ---------------------
#   ▶ Local Development (MacBook):
#     COMPOSE_PROFILES=local docker compose up --build
#
#   ▶ AWS EC2 Production Only:
#     COMPOSE_PROFILES=prod docker compose up -d
#
#   ▶ AWS EC2 Development Only:
#     COMPOSE_PROFILES=dev docker compose up -d --build
#
#   ▶ AWS EC2 Both Environments:
#     COMPOSE_PROFILES=prod,dev docker compose up -d
#
# DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY:
# -------------------
#   ▶ Production: Automated via CI/CD on main branch
#     - Uses pre-built ECR images for fast, reliable deployments
#     - Images are built, tested, and pushed by GitHub Actions
#     - Zero build time on EC2, atomic deployments
#
#   ▶ Development: Manual trigger via workflow_dispatch
#     - Builds directly on EC2 for flexibility
#     - No ECR push, saves CI/CD minutes and complexity
#     - Perfect for testing and iteration

  # PRODUCTION SERVICES (AWS EC2)
  # =============================================================================
  # These services run optimized production builds with:
  # - Pre-built ECR images (no build time on deployment)
  # - Health checks for reliability and load balancer integration
  # - Automatic restart policies for high availability
  # - Production environment variables and secrets
  # - Atomic deployments via docker compose pull + up -d

  # DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (AWS EC2 Sandbox)
  # =============================================================================
  # These services run on EC2 for remote development/testing:
  # - Pull pre-built images from Docker Hub (fast deployments)
  # - Images built and pushed via CI/CD on dev branch pushes
  # - Different ports to avoid conflicts with production
  # - Cost-optimized using free Docker Hub public repositories
  # - Provides experience with dual-registry strategy (Docker Hub + ECR)

  # - Development builds with full dependencies and debugging tools
  # - File watching for automatic updates via CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING
  # - Named volumes to preserve node_modules across container restarts
