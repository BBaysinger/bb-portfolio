      "<p>Obviously, you can't put your portfolio in your own portfolio without subjecting the spacetime continuum to a feedback loop, but fortunately, I'm not trying to avoid that. In all seriousness, this portfolio is not just a showcase of my workâ€”it's a project I built to deepen my experience with React and modern front-end architecture, and to show the level of polish I can put into projects.</p>",
      "<p>At its core, it features a highly flexible carousel component (you're looking at it), designed for seamless interactivity. This carousel supports dynamic routing, browser-native gesture-based navigation, and synchronization with multiple carousels for unique effects, including parallaxing. This is best experienced with a laptop/trackpad or touchscreen. (I'll later add click/drag support for a similar experience for mouse/pointer input.)</p>",
      "<p>This project is a long way from complete. It has a Node/Express backend comming that I started a while back, and enumerable features and enhancements that I'm always brainstorming. (But I'm already thinking about my <i>next</i> portfolio, which will be massively different but will borrow a few features from here.)</p>",

      "<p>As mentioned, I've been deepening my experience with React. This is a reusable React slideshow component with full SPA (single-page app) features that I developed for, among other things, a deep dive into React hooks and state management.</p>",
      "<p>Designed with scalability, performance, and accessibility in mind, it supports auto-slide functionality, deep linking via dynamic routing, and intuitive user interactions such as pausing, resuming, and manual navigation.</p>",
      "<p>The component is highly configurable, allowing developers to pass in slides as an array of objects containing foreground and background images, thumbnails, and JSX content. It dynamically adjusts its height based on slide content to eliminate excess whitespace, ensuring an elegant layout across devices. Additionally, it integrates lazy-loaded images and optimized animations to deliver a smooth experience with minimal performance overhead.</p>",
      "<p>It also supports custom navigation controls. There are two options out of the box, plus you can make your own and even add multiple sets.</p>",
      "<p>There's more info in the repo. It's still pretty new, so there's more to come in the build and documentation. It's an example of code quality, so if JavaScript is your thing, please take a gander at the solutions it contains in the repo.</p>"
