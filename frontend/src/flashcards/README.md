# Flashcards (Temporary)

Small, copy/paste-ready snippets for interview study.

- `react-router/` shows a component that reads a React Router v6 route param (`useParams`) + REST fetch.
- `nextjs-app-router/` shows a component that reads a Next.js App Router param (`useParams`) + REST fetch.

Note: This folder intentionally contains only components (no page or router setup).
