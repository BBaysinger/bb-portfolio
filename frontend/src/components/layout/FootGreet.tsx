        Good {currentTimeOfDay}, and thanks for stopping by! I&apos;ll be
        honestâ€”this space is an experiment in progress, and I hope it always
        stays that way. Some things might seem a bit mysterious, but give it
        time and check back later!

      <p>
        Anyhow, I&apos;m always looking to collaborate with forward-thinking
        teams who value engaging digital experiences. I look forward to
        connecting and exploring how I can bring unique interactive work to your
        organization.
