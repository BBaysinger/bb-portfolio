# Portfolio Frontend (Next.js)

This is the frontend service for the BB Portfolio website, built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript.

## Features

- Interactive parallax project carousel
- Animated sprite system and kinetic orb
- Fluid responsive design system
- SSR/SSG portfolio rendering
- NDA-aware content routing
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Development

The frontend runs as part of the Docker Compose development environment. From the repository root:

```bash
npm run caddy:up
```

Open [http://localhost](http://localhost) with your browser to see the result.

### Alternative: Standalone Development

For frontend-only development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) - note that backend features will require the backend service to be running.

## Key Components

### Interactive Systems

- **Parallax Carousel**: Multi-layer synchronized scrolling with touch/swipe support
- **Fluxel Grid**: Animated pixel grid with simulated 3D depth effects
- **Kinetic Orb**: Physics-based interactive animation

### Responsive Design

- **Fluid Variables**: JavaScript-powered CSS custom properties for smooth scaling
- **SCSS Mixins**: `remRange`, `staticRange`, and `scaleRange` for different scaling needs
- **Mobile-First**: Progressive enhancement approach

### Routing & Data

- **SSR Projects List**: Server-side rendered project listings
- **SSG Project Pages**: Static generation with ISR for performance
- **NDA Segmentation**: Separate `/project/` and `/nda/` routes for content safety

## Environment Configuration

The frontend adapts to different environments:

- Backend health check optimization for CI/CD vs runtime
- Environment-aware API endpoints
- Dynamic route generation based on available projects

## Deployment

This application is deployed using Docker containers on AWS EC2 with Nginx reverse proxy. See the main README and deployment documentation for infrastructure details.
