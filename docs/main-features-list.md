Here's what GTP suggested:

I reviewed your current features list and scanned the repo (frontend carousel code, Payload config/collections, infra/deploy docs and scripts) to propose concrete additions you can highlight next.

What I looked at (quick pass)
main-features-list.md and top-level README
Backend Payload config, collections, and SES email service
Frontend carousel/layered parallax components
Deploy/IaC scripts and Terraform layout
Suggested additions for the features list
Frontend UX/interaction

Developer experience/testing

monorepo with strict typescript on frontend and backend
unified eslint configs for frontend/backend

local dev proxy and hot-reload compose profile
Data ops and backups
