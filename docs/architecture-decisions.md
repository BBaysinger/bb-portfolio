# Architecture Decisions Log

This file records major technical decisions for the portfolio project.  
Each entry includes the date, decision, reasoning, alternatives, and current status.  
New decisions should be appended chronologically.

## 2025-09-14 ‚Äì Database

**Decision:** Use **MongoDB Atlas (cloud-managed MongoDB)**  
**Reasoning:**

- Avoid operational overhead of running a database on EC2.
- Free/low-tier Atlas is sufficient for project scale.
- Provides automatic backups and scaling without extra config.

**Alternatives considered:**

- **Postgres in Docker on EC2**: Would require persistence management (EBS volumes), more setup, higher memory use.
- **Self-hosted Mongo in Docker**: More maintenance, less reliable.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Active

## 2025-09-14 ‚Äì Hosting Strategy

**Decision:** Deploy **frontend + backend via Docker Compose on a single EC2 instance**.  
**Reasoning:**

- Cheapest always-on option (~$7‚Äì15/mo).
- Keeps frontend + backend isolated but still running on the same box.
- Compose already works locally, so deployment pipeline is straightforward.
- Professional-looking: shows containerization, CI/CD, and environment separation.

**Alternatives considered:**

- **ECS Fargate**: More modern/serverless, but ~$30‚Äì40/mo always-on (too expensive for year-round personal site).
- **App Runner**: Simpler and handles HTTPS/scaling automatically, but ~$15‚Äì20/mo idle cost is higher than EC2.
- **Separate EC2 for frontend and backend**: Cleaner isolation, but doubles costs.
- **S3 + CloudFront for frontend**: Cheaper if site were purely static, but not feasible since we need SSR + API routes.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Active

## 2025-09-14 ‚Äì CI/CD

**Decision:** Use **GitHub Actions** to deploy on push.

- **dev branch** ‚Üí deploy to `dev` environment on EC2.
- **main branch** ‚Üí deploy to `prod` environment on EC2.

**Reasoning:**

- Demonstrates real-world CI/CD workflow.
- Easy integration with GitHub repo.
- Keeps deployment automated and repeatable.

**Alternatives considered:**

- Manual SSH + docker-compose up (too manual, not professional).
- Other CI/CD services (CircleCI, GitLab CI): possible, but GitHub Actions is simpler and free.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Active

## 2025-09-14 ‚Äì Dev Environment Hosting

**Decision:** Run **both dev and prod environments on the same EC2 instance** using separate Docker Compose projects.

- Reverse proxy routes traffic:
  - `mysite.com` ‚Üí prod containers
  - `dev.mysite.com` ‚Üí dev containers

**Reasoning:**

- Avoids cost of a second EC2 instance (~$7‚Äì8/mo).
- Still provides a live dev environment accessible at a separate subdomain.
- Keeps deployment consistent with production (same stack).
- Sufficient for portfolio purposes even if dev impacts prod occasionally.

**Alternatives considered:**

- **Separate EC2 instance for dev**: Cleaner isolation, but doubles costs.
- **Ephemeral dev envs (Fly.io, Railway, etc.)**: Cheaper, but less consistent with prod.
- **Local-only dev**: Fine for personal use, but doesn‚Äôt provide a shareable dev URL.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Active

## 2025-09-15 ‚Äì Instance Consolidation & Key Management

**Decision:** Consolidate to a single EC2 instance named `portfolio` with one keypair.  
**Reasoning:**

- Simplifies management (one server to update/patch).
- Avoids confusion of juggling multiple `.pem` files.
- Clearer mental model for deployment pipeline (prod + dev both on one host).

**Alternatives considered:**

- **Two separate EC2 instances (frontend + backend)**: Tested, but unnecessarily complex and doubled cost.
- **Separate dev EC2**: Cleaner but unjustifiable cost.
- **Reusing multiple keypairs**: Works, but adds complexity for no real gain.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Active

## 2025-09-16 ‚Äì Base OS Migration

**Decision:** Standardize on **Debian (Bookworm)** as the base OS for the EC2 instance.  
**Reasoning:**

- More stable and lightweight than Ubuntu, with fewer default packages and less bloat.
- Security updates are more conservative, reducing risk of sudden package breakage.
- Long support cycles make it easier to ‚Äúset and forget‚Äù for a low-maintenance portfolio server.
- Strong ecosystem and compatibility with Docker + CI/CD workflows.
- Clean baseline for learning: demonstrates deliberate OS choice and shows knowledge of trade-offs.

**Alternatives considered:**

- **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**: Familiar, widely documented, but slightly heavier and more prone to frequent package churn.
- **Amazon Linux 2023**: Tight AWS integration and security patches, but smaller community and not as general-purpose.
- **Alpine Linux**: Extremely lightweight, but would require extra effort for tooling/packages, and debugging can be harder.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Active

## 2025-09-18 ‚Äì Dev Deployment Strategy

**Decision:** Keep **dev environment rebuilds manual on EC2**, while keeping **prod automated via CI/CD**.  

- **Prod (`main` branch)** ‚Üí Auto build/test/push via GitHub Actions ‚Üí push images to ECR ‚Üí deploy with `docker compose --profile prod`.  
- **Dev (`dev` branch)** ‚Üí Manual trigger: SSH into EC2 or run a GitHub Actions workflow button to pull latest code and run `docker compose --profile dev up -d --build`.  

**Reasoning:**

- Keeps CI/CD simple: only `main` branch triggers full rebuilds and ECR pushes.  
- Avoids unnecessary rebuilds every time code is pushed to `dev` (saves CI/CD minutes and clutter).  
- Still provides a live dev sandbox on EC2 (`dev.mysite.com`) for testing, but updates happen only when explicitly triggered.  
- Reflects professional workflow separation: **prod is automated, dev is flexible/manual**.  

**Alternatives considered:**

- **Have `dev` auto-deploy like prod**: More consistent, but wastes builds on half-finished commits and requires managing separate ECR repos.  

**Status:** ‚úÖ Active
