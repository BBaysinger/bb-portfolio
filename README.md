## Features

- **Native Swipe Parallax Carousel**: Previews for each portfolio project are presented through an infinite parallax carousel with seamless, native left/right user swiping. There are reasons you've probably never seen a carousel like this.
  - **Device Overlays**: Screenshots are dynamically overlaid onto mobile and desktop device mockups for a professional presentation.
  - **Dynamic Routing**: Each slide is linked through dynamic routing, ensuring a smooth and engaging user experience with deep linkning available.
  - **Actionable Links**: Includes buttons to access:
    - Code repositories
    - Video project walkthroughs
    - Live or staging deployments
- **Modern Design**: Responsive and visually appealing UI designed to showcase my work.
- **Dynamic Components**: Includes reusable components.
- **Scalability**: Built with a focus on maintainability and expansion.

## Roadmap

- **Backend Integration**: Integrate a fully custom backend using Express, MongoDB, and Redux. I have functioning boilerplate started for this in another repo that's ready to repurpose.
- **Project Enhancements**: I see defects in some of my portfolio projects as they age. Those are in separate repos, but this is on my radar. Some of them I'd love to upgrade to their current framework versions.
- **Walktrough Videos Play in Project Carousel** This would be a dream, but I'll need to come back to it after the previous items.
- **Additional Features**: Many more ideas for future improvements and features are under consideration that I'll need to have a lot of free time for, lol.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-End**: React, TypeScript, JSX, SCSS
- **Back-End**: TypeScript, React Router, React Redux
- **Tooling**: Vite, ESLint, Prettier
