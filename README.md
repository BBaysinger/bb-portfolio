# Portfolio Website

A modern portfolio website featuring custom interactive components built with React, TypeScript, and Next.js. The site includes a parallax project carousel, animated sprite system, and responsive design components. All animations and visual effects are implemented using native web technologies without external 3D or physics libraries.

The deployment pipeline uses Terraform for infrastructure provisioning, Docker for containerization, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The system supports multiple environments (dev/prod) with separate container registries and S3 storage buckets.

### üé® Frontend UX & Interaction

- Parallax Project Carousel with swipe navigation and deep linking
- Animated grid system with simulated 3D depth effects
- Interactive kinetic orb with physics-based movement
- Sprite sheet renderer supporting CSS, Canvas, and WebGL
- Fluid responsive design system with CSS scaling variables
- Animation sequencer for sprite-based effects
- Mobile-optimized slide-out navigation
- Interactive footer and scroll-aware navigation highlighting
- Device mockup overlays with tilt effects
- Mobile-first responsive design approach

### üìù CMS, Data Modeling & Rendering

- Payload CMS Backend (type-safe with generated types)
- SSR portfolio projects list (Next.js)
- SSG dynamic routing projects view (Next.js)
- Automatic slug generation and sortable index
- NDA route segmentation and content safety
  - Public route `/project/[projectId]` never includes NDA items in the active dataset (even when authenticated)
  - NDA-only route `/nda/[projectId]` requires authentication and is rendered dynamically per request
  - Authenticated requests to a public NDA slug redirect server-side to `/nda/[projectId]`; unauthenticated sees 404
  - Client carousel and prev/next links are route-aware (public ‚Üí `/project/*`, NDA ‚Üí `/nda/*`) without leaking NDA data
- Rich project metadata (brand, tags, role, year, awards, urls)
- Image collections for screenshots, thumbnails, brand logos
- Image processing via Sharp (server-side resizing) with 2 MB upload limit

### üíæ Storage & Media Pipeline

- S3-backed media storage with per-collection prefixes
- Instance-role support with optional static credentials
- Media migration/verification scripts
  - migrate media to S3, update media URLs, rebuild records
- Local filesystem storage for local profile

### üîí API & Security

- Env-profile guardrails (fail-fast config validation)
- Locked-down CSRF/CORS allowlists per environment
- Role-based access control for admin-only mutations
- Health-check endpoint for uptime/deploy validation
- Contact API via AWS SES (see `docs/aws-ses-setup.md`)

### ‚ö° DevOps & Deployment

- Automated (re)deployment orchestrator script
  - Destroys and rebuilds/pushes the entire EC2 and containers
  - Builtin Safety checks
  - Avoids destroying items meant to persist
- Terraform IaC: one-command provision/teardown
- Systemd-managed Docker services on EC2 (auto-restart)
- Dual registry strategy (Docker Hub dev, ECR prod)
- Secure Docker builds (BuildKit secret mounts, minimal args)
- Generated env files on host via CI/CD (no secrets in repo)
- Github Secrets Synchronization from JSON5 via custom shell script
- Reverse proxy options: Caddy or Nginx (compose/configs provided)
- Compose profiles for local/dev/prod and proxy-only

### üõ†Ô∏è Developer Experience & Testing

- Monorepo with strict TypeScript (frontend and backend)
- Unified ESLint configurations
- Playwright E2E and Vitest setup (backend)
- Local dev proxy and hot-reload compose profile
- **JSON5 Package Sync System** - Dual package.json approach
  - `package.json` - Standard JSON for tooling compatibility
  - `package.json5` - Enhanced version with comments and documentation
  - Bidirectional sync via `npm run sync:json5`
  - Preserves comments and formatting in JSON5 files

### üíø Data Ops & Backups

- JSON dumps for seed data and repeatable imports
- Automated database backups with dated folders

### üñºÔ∏è Image Processing

- Custom Sprite Sheet Processing Scripts
  - In a separate repo: [github.com/BBaysinger/fluxel-animations](https://github.com/BBaysinger/fluxel-animations)

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: Next.js, React, TypeScript, SCSS Modules
- Backend: Payload CMS (Next.js runtime), TypeScript
- State: Redux Toolkit (frontend auth/session), React hooks
- Testing: Playwright, Vitest
- Tooling: ESLint, Prettier, Docker, Node.js
- Cloud/IaC: AWS (EC2, S3, ECR, IAM, SES, Route 53, ACM), Terraform

## Roadmap

- Additional polish, accessibility, and performance passes as time allows
- Make the hero animation more game-like
  - Still exploring rendering capabilities to know just how much I can get out of it
  - But it will become more than just a fidget spinner
- Most of the notable features will become their own portable repos
- Filterable Project Tags/Categories
- Interactive tutorials for the kinetic orb (vs current arrow/tooltips) and carousel
- Walkthrough videos playable within the project carousel
- Project upkeep: framework/library upgrades across showcased projects
- Global light/dark mode preferences via Redux
- Fluxels should be implemented in WebGl and/or Pixi shaders
- Implement Testing Frameworks (once experiments have matured)
- Capture and Store Data about user interactions
- Accessability should be improved with respect to ARIA, rem font scaling, etc...
- Remove Bootstrap (Not relying on it much anyhow)
- Header animations will be in response to user interactions vs just a timer

Note: Earlier plans for ‚Äúcustom Express/Mongo backend‚Äù were superseded by the fully integrated Payload CMS backend present in this repo.

## Infrastructure & Deployment

This portfolio is deployed using Infrastructure as Code with Terraform and Docker on AWS.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

- Cloud Provider: Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform (automated provisioning/teardown)
- Compute: EC2 t3.medium (automated configuration via user_data)
- Reverse Proxy: Caddy or Nginx (configs and compose profiles included)
- Containerization: Docker with dual registry strategy (Docker Hub + ECR)
- Storage: S3 buckets for media assets with environment isolation
- Networking: Elastic IP (44.246.43.116), Security Groups, VPC integration
- Domain & DNS: Custom domain (bbinteractive.io) with Route 53 hosted zone
- TLS: AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) with DNS validation via Route 53

### üöÄ Deployment Process

Provision/destroy the infrastructure with Terraform:

```bash
# Deploy complete infrastructure
cd infra/
terraform plan    # Review changes
terraform apply   # Deploy infrastructure (creates many AWS resources)

# Destroy infrastructure
terraform destroy # Clean teardown of all resources
```

What happens during deployment:

1. AWS resources are created (EC2, Elastic IP, Security Groups, IAM roles, S3, ECR)
2. Automated configuration installs Docker and application services via user_data
3. Containers are started (dev from Docker Hub, prod from ECR)
4. Systemd services provide auto-restart and boot persistence
5. Route 53 A/ALIAS records point the domain to the Elastic IP (or load balancer in future scaling)

### üê≥ Container Management

Dual registry strategy:

- Development: Docker Hub images (`bhbaysinger/bb-portfolio-*:dev`)
- Production: Amazon ECR images (`*.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bb-portfolio-*:latest`)

Helper scripts (from `infra/bb-portfolio-management.sh`):

```bash
# Switch between environments
./bb-portfolio-management.sh switch dev   # Use Docker Hub images
./bb-portfolio-management.sh switch prod  # Use ECR images
./bb-portfolio-management.sh status       # Check container health
./bb-portfolio-management.sh deploy       # Deploy from ECR
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Production Features

- Automated configuration via Terraform and user_data scripts
- Container auto-restart through systemd services
- Environment isolation with separate S3 buckets and configurations
- Security through IAM roles, encrypted storage, and security groups
- Prepared for scaling with load balancers and auto-scaling groups
- Cost optimization through appropriate resource sizing

### üìä Infrastructure Components

- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Container orchestration with Docker and systemd
- Automated deployment workflows
- System reliability with auto-restart and health monitoring
